# Portfolio Overview
Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository showcases a selection of projects that highlight my skills in data analysis, process optimization, automation, and database management. Below are three main projects that demonstrate how I leverage tools like Power BI, Python, and SQL to solve real-world problems and create value through data-driven solutions:
# Power BI: Process Optimization and Mechanical Problem Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing data from a .csv file containing the operational performance of two machines. By examining mechanical issues and downtime problems, I developed insights to help direct corrective efforts, leading to process optimization. The result? Reduced lost hours and fewer product defects, ultimately improving operational efficiency.
# Python: Automation of Data Entry Processes
Using Python, I created a solution to reduce the time required to fill out a form that involved image files and data stored in an Excel file. By automating the process across all web form fields, this project significantly increased efficiency and eliminated repetitive manual tasks.
# SQL: Sports Team Database Management
In this project, I designed and maintained a database for a sports team, enabling the extraction of valuable information for decision-making. The database provided insights that enhanced operational strategies and allowed the team to make data-driven decisions efficiently.
